## Installing packages

```r
# From CRAN
source('http://callr.org/install#knitr')

# From Bioconductor
source('http://callr.org/install#limma')

# From GitHub
source('http://callr.org/install#rstudio/rmarkdown')

All dependent packages will be installed.  If a requested package is already installed and up-to-date, it will not be reinstalled.  All installed packages will be updated.

You can install multiple packages by separating them with commas, e.g.
```r
source('http://callr.org/install#knitr,rstudio/rmarkdown')
