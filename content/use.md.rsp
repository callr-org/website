## Loading packages (with automatic installation)

**IMPORTANT: In order for the below to work on _Windows_, you need to set `options(url.method = "libcurl")` first.**
<br>

```r
## Windows users only
options(url.method = "libcurl")

# From CRAN
source('https://callr.org/use#data.table')

# From Bioconductor
source('https://callr.org/use#limma')

# From GitHub
source('https://callr.org/use#rstudio/rmarkdown')
```

All missing and required packages will be installed automatically.  If a requested package is already installed and up-to-date, it will not be reinstalled.  All installed packages will be updated.

You can load multiple packages by separating them with commas, e.g.
```r
source('https://callr.org/use#data.table,rstudio/rmarkdown')
```
