## Installing Bioconductor packages

```r
source('http://callr.org/biocLite#limma,edgeR')
```

This is a one-line call identical to
```r
source('http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R')
biocLite(c('limma', 'edgeR'))
```

The `biocLite` command:

* Works in a freshly installed R session.
* Requires no prior package installations.
* Will always install requested packages regardless whether they are already installed or not.  To avoid this, use the [`install`](install.html) command.
