## Installing packages

**IMPORTANT: In order for the below to work on _Windows_, you need to set `options(url.method = "libcurl")` first.**
<br>

```r
## Windows users only
options(url.method = "libcurl")

# From CRAN
source('https://callr.org/install#knitr')

# From Bioconductor
source('https://callr.org/install#limma')

# From GitHub
source('https://callr.org/install#rstudio/rmarkdown')
source('https://callr.org/install#HenrikBengtsson/R.utils@develop')

# Multiple packages from mixed sources
source('https://callr.org/install#knitr,rstudio/rmarkdown')
```

<%@ifdef name="front"%>
All dependent packages will be installed.  If a requested package is already installed and up-to-date, it will not be reinstalled.  All installed packages will be updated.
<%@else%>
The `install` command:

* Works in a freshly installed R session.
* Requires no prior package installations.
* All required packages will be installed automatically.
* Updates old packages.
* Avoids re-installation by skipping already existing versions.
* Optional packages (e.g. `Suggests: ggplot2`) are not installed by default, but if they are also marked as recommended (e.g. `SuggestsNote: Recommended: ggplot2`) it will be installed. See [PSCBS](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/PSCBS/blob/master/DESCRIPTION#L19-L23) for an example. This is a callr.org-specific feature.
